CS0029=Cannot implicitly convert type ''{0}'' to ''{1}''
CS0100=The parameter name ''{0}'' is a duplicate
CS0101=The namespace ''{0}'' already contains a definition for ''{1}''
CS0102=The type ''{0}'' already contains a definition for ''{1}''
CS0106=The modifier ''{0}'' is not valid for this item
CS0107=More than one protection modifier specified
CS0128=A local variable named ''{0}'' is already defined in this scope
CS0136=A local variable named ''{0}'' cannot be declared in this scope because it would give a different meaning to ''{1}'', \
  which is already used in a 'parent or current' scope to denote something else
CS0155=The type caught or thrown must be derived from System.Exception
CS0168=The variable ''{0}'' is declared but never used
CS0214=Pointers and fixed size buffers may only be used in an unsafe context
CS0219=The variable ''{0}'' is assigned but its value is never used
CS0227=Unsafe code requires the 'unsafe' command line option to be specified
CS0231=A parameter array must be the last parameter in a formal parameter list
CS0304=Cannot create an instance of the variable type ''{0}'' because it does not have the new() constraint
CS0401=The 'new()' constraint must be the last constraint specified
CS0409=A constraint clause has already been specified for type parameter ''{0}''
CS0413=The ''{0}'' operator cannot be used with a non-reference type parameter ''{1}''. Consider adding 'class' or a reference type constraint
CS0449=The 'class' or 'struct' constraint must be the first constraint specified (CS0449)
CS0516=Constructor ''{0}'' cannot call itself
CS0815=An implicitly typed local variable declaration cannot be initialized with 'anonymous method'
CS1004=Duplicate ''{0}'' modifier
CS1100=Method ''{0}'' has a parameter modifier 'this' which is not on the first parameter
CS1644=Feature ''{0}'' cannot be used because it is not part of the C# {1} language specification
CS1737=Optional parameters must appear after all required parameters
